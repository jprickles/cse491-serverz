 *     successfully implemented a new page for the image app that displays all current
 *     images that are uploaded to the server. This was done by creating a new page to
 *     render that was passed the dictionary of all current pictures, then iterating through
 *     this using a jinja, each image_num was passed via parsing the incoming request for 
 *     the image for the 'special' variable that was used in calling the get_image app 
 *     ~NOTE: Implemented on imageapp, but was unsure of wither it should be on my app or not.
