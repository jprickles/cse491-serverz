 *     successfully implemented a new page for the image app that displays all current
 *     images that are uploaded to the server. This was done by creating a new page to
 *     render that was passed the dictionary of all current pictures, then iterating through
 *     this using a jinja, each image_num was passed via parsing the incoming request for 
 *     the image for the 'special' variable that was used in calling the get_image app 
 *     ~NOTE: Implemented on imageapp, but was unsure of wither it should be on my app or not.
 
  3.25.14
 -------------HW9----------------
 * Implemented the Quotes application into server.py
 * Implemented the Chat application as well into server.py
 *     -Also added timestamp into chat window by taking timestamp and formatting it into 
 *          human readable time string
 * Chose Project #4 which was to add TIFF and JPEG image handling to the imageapp. This was done
 *     by first altering the image.py function add_image to allow another parameter to be passed which
 *     would be the type of the image, storing both in a list. Next, in root.py upload recieve was 
 *     altered such that it took the full file path from the form and extracted the file 
 *     type from there. Then checking for differences like "jpg" and "jpeg." Next, the get image
 *     method had to be altered to adjust for the different response types based on the image. 
 *     Which is basically the second element in the list, returning the first which is the data portion
 *     of the image. Similarly using this method, I altered the page in which it displayed a list of 
 *     images that had been uploaded, allowing for this functionality to work as well. 
 *     !! Only issue that arose was displaying the TIFF images, they are not supported in chrome or firefox
